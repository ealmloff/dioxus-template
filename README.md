# Overview

**This repo is not intended to be `git cloned`**.

This repo is used by `dx new` when starting new projects. The CLI relies on [cargo-generate](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate) to create and use these templates.

### Organization

This repository is organized into three sub-templates:
- `Bare-Bones` - A single file bare-bones Dioxus project.
- `Jumpstart` - A more structured jumpstart with a starting file structure.
- `Workspace` - A full workspace with a crate for shared functionality and every platform.

All templates support every platform, router, and fullstack.

### Local Development
To run and test the templates without `dx`, you can run `cargo generate --path myPathToTemplates`

The templates have a few different scripts:
- `init.rhai` runs first and sets variables that tell the `init-common.rhai` script what this template needs.
- `init-common.rhai` is a common script for all the templates which asks for a variety of information from the user.
- `vars.rhai` is a script that can set additional variables based on the already-ran scripts. For example, generating a new string to insert into the template based on previous variables.
- `conditional-files.rhai` runs last and deletes files and folders based on the variables set by `init-common.rhai`.
